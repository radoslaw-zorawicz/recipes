Ingredients

    1 cup boiling water
    1 green tea bag
    1 cup milk (1% or soy)
    1 cup old fashioned oats
    1 tablespoon ground flaxseed meal
    1 tablespoon honey
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    Â½ cup toppings (e.g. banana, dried fruit, chopped nuts, flaked coconut)

Instructions

Combine boiling water with the green tea bag in a saucepan and let them steep for 5 minutes together.Add in milk, oats, and ground flaxseed meal and turn the heat on to medium, beginning to stir when the liquid bubbles. Cook for 5-6 minutes and then turn off the heat. It should be thick and stick to your spoon - feel free to add additional liquid (water, milk, or additional green tea) now if you prefer thinner oatmeal.
Stir in 1 tablespoon of honey and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and then let the oatmeal sit for a minute.
Split the oatmeal into two bowls and top with your favorite toppings.
